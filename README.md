# From Newbies for Newbies: 
## BASH! 
Bash is a [command processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command-line_interpreter) that typically runs in a [text window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a [shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script).
